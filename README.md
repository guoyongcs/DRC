### [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07929.pdf)


This repository contains the official Pytorch implementation and the pretrained models of [Towards Lightweight Super-Resolution with Dual Regression Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07929.pdf).



## Catalog
- [x] Pre-trained models of some large SR models enhanced by our Dual Regression (DR)
- [x] Pre-trained models of the non-blind SR models compressed by our Dual Regression Compression (DRC)
- [x] Pre-trained models of the blind SR models compressed by our Dual Regression Compression (DRC)
- [x] Evaluation and Training Code

All the above will be released very soon.
